# Currency Generator

## ðŸ“– Desciption


The Currency Converter is a TUI (Text User Interface) application that allows you to select a currency and amount to convert. It can handle multiple currencies at once. The application uses the [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/) API to fetch currency values and perform conversions and for the interface uses [Huh?](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) from [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet). Built in Go, the app also allows you to copy the conversion result to your clipboard for easy access.
